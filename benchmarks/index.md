## Magic angle renormalization in twisted bilayer graphene

We can calculate the electronic bandstructure of twisted bilayer graphene
where we used our SHE model which is an improved Two-Center (TC) model which
has been optimized to capture the DFT Tunneling at the K-point while allowing
the user to tune it to capture the magic angle at a specific value. Here we
set S so that the magic angle occurs at 1.08 degree when using the relaxed
structures from an energy minimization using LAMMPS based on
EXX-RPA-informed registry-dependent force fields. The intralayer terms used
here in LAMMPS are either the widely used REBO2 forcefields or the
machine-learning based GAP20 potential.

## Twisted multilayer graphene electric bandstructures

A wide variety of layered materials can be considered in GRABNES. Here we
implemented the Hamiltonian part of the code in such a way that a 20 layers
twisted graphene system clearly showing the family of tBG bands that are
expected in such tNG system. A flag in the GRABNES input file can be added to
activate a perpendicular electric field.

## Twisted bilayer graphene: band-unfolding

Our code allows to calculate the band-unfolded band structures that can help
to understand experimental ARPES measurements. Here we observe good agreement
between the experimental features obtained using nano-ARPES and simulated
features obtained using our package.
